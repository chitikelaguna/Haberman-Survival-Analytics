# Haberman-Survival-Analytics
# 📊 SurvivorLens – Breast Cancer Survival Analysis

A data analysis project using the **Haberman’s Survival Dataset**, focused on exploring and visualizing the survival patterns of breast cancer patients who underwent surgery. The project leverages Python libraries like **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn** to extract insights from the dataset.

## 📁 Dataset Information

- **Source:** [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Haberman%27s+Survival)
- **Attributes:**
  - `age`: Age of patient at time of operation
  - `year`: Year of operation (year - 1900)
  - `nodes`: Number of positive axillary nodes detected
  - `status`: Survival status (1 = survived 5+ years, 2 = died within 5 years)

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **NumPy**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**
- Jupyter Notebook (optional)

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Load and understand the structure of the dataset.
- Clean and preprocess the data.
- Perform statistical analysis using NumPy and Pandas.
- Create visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Derive insights related to patient age, surgery year, node count, and survival status.

---

## 🔍 Key Features

- Descriptive statistics (mean, std, median) using NumPy and Pandas.
- Grouped analysis (e.g., average nodes per survival class).
- Visualizations:
  - Histograms of patient age
  - Bar chart of surgeries per year
  - Scatter plots (e.g., age vs. nodes)
  - Boxplots and pairplots by survival status
  - Heatmap of feature correlations
